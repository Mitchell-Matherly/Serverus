What is Serverus?

Serverus is a suite of beginner-friendly software aimed at making self-hosting approachable, reliable, and collaborative. 

In a world where cloud rescources and the internet in general are increasingly owned by a decreasing amount of companies, your options for cloud-based services are usually locked behind a subscription service. Those services can have price hikes at any given time, and without alternatives people are simply forced to pay them. 

But the truth is that most cloud-based services can be easily run on a multitude of cheap, old machines-- more reliably than you would originally think. Just one issue… not everyone wants to administrate dozens of services. Mostly, they just want to focus on what they are passionate about.

That’s where Serverus comes in. Serverus takes your services and puts them all behind a single IP address. One domain, unlimited services. Focus on the services you love. Share them with your group. Everyone benefits.

Want to leave? That’s easy too. Serverus CVHs have zero trust between hosts by defualt. You keep all your data, and your machine remains basically unchanged. Leaving is as simple as issuing one command and getting on with your life. 

Fast, painless, and secure. Serverus allows people of all different skill levels to collborate and free themselves from corporate cloud infrastructure.
